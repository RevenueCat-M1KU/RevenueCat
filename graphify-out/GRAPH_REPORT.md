## Knowledge Gaps

- **56 isolated node(s):** `$schema`, `printWidth`, `singleQuote`, `semi`, `trailingComma` (+51 more)
  These have ≤1 connection - possible missing edges or undocumented components. (Counts symbols only; 64 node(s) total have ≤1 connection when file, concept and rationale nodes are included.)
- **3 thin communities (<3 nodes) omitted from report** — run `graphify query` to explore isolated nodes.
