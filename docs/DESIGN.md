# Guessling design

How Guessling looks, moves, sounds, and reads: the design system and art
direction for the iPhone app, the paywall's styling, the three web pages,
the app icon, and the store and pitch assets. It follows Google's
[DESIGN.md format][gdm], so design and coding agents can read its tokens,
and it turns the [product's](/docs/PRODUCT.md) character into parts, poses,
and timings that the [technical requirements](/docs/TRD.md) build and the
[product requirements](/docs/PRD.md) test. Facts are as of September 22,
2026; every color, size, and duration this document sets is a design
decision.

## Overview

```yaml
version: alpha
name: Guessling
description: >-
  A daily 20-questions game for iPhone. A small marigold creature keeps the
  day's answer on a card and answers yes-or-no questions with its whole body.
```

### The reference

A card game on a blue table. The Guessling, a small marigold creature, keeps
the day's answer on a card, face down, and every question the player asks
goes down on an index card beside it, one line each, with the Guessling's
answer at the end. When the round ends, the Guessling turns the card over.

- **Why a reference.** Google's format says "Adjectives describe a region. A
  specific reference describes a point.", and Anthropic's design skill finds
  distinctive choices in "The subject's industry, subject matter, materials,
  and vernacular" ([trends notes][ft-gdm]). Twenty Questions is a parlor
  game with one secret; the card makes the secret something you can see.
- **Why this one.** A written-down answer is the product's promise: it was
  settled before anyone asked, and it's the same for everyone
  ([product principles][product-principles]).
- **What it gives each surface.** The table is the field, the index card
  holds the round, the answer card is the reveal, the archive is a box of
  past cards, and the icon is the Guessling with its "?".
- **Atmosphere.** A calm table and a lively character: the interface stays
  still and plain, so the Guessling's reactions carry the feeling, as
  Anthropic's skill puts it, "Spend your boldness in one place".

### Principles

Each principle settles a trade-off.

- **The answer is the hero.** The latest answer's words, glyph, and pose are
  the biggest things on screen, and nothing moves behind them (ASK-2).
- **Every signal twice.** Each answer shows its words and a glyph, whatever
  the color, motion, sound, or haptic adds, so a round works in grayscale,
  on mute, with Reduce Motion, and with VoiceOver (A11Y-1, A11Y-3, A11Y-4).
- **Never in the way.** The words land within 100 ms of the answer, and no
  animation holds up the next question.
- **Kind on a miss.** A No or a wrong guess gets a friendly head shake,
  never a red flash, a buzzer, or a word that blames.
- **Native first.** System faces, SF Symbols, system sheets and bars,
  RevenueCat's native paywall, and Liquid Glass where iOS puts it. Custom
  drawing is kept for what is Guessling's own: the character, the notepad,
  and the turn meter.
- **Built in a day.** Every element has a version the team can ship on
  September 24, 2026, and polish can follow in an update, as the idea's art
  risk plans ([idea risks][idea-risks]).
- **Private by construction.** Nothing in the app or on the web pages loads
  a font, a script, or an image from a third party.

### Scope

- **In:** the app's screens and states, the Guessling, the paywall's
  styling, the `/privacy`, `/terms`, and `/support` pages, the app icon and
  launch screen, the App Store screenshots, the Devpost images, and the
  look of the demo video.
- **Out:** a landing page, since the App Store page is one; an iPad layout,
  since the app runs at phone size there (COMPAT-3); an image share card,
  since results share as text (SHARE-1); and any appearance setting inside
  the app.
